## Deformable Convolutional Networks V2 with Pytorch 1.0

## CPU and GPU version

### Build
```bash
    ./make.sh         # build
    python testcpu.py    # run examples and gradient check on cpu
    python testcuda.py   # run examples and gradient check on gpu 
```
This repository contains the Pytorch DCNv2 implementation by Charles Shang. It has been modified so that it can run on both CPU and GPU.
